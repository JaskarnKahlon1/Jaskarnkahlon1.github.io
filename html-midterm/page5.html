     <h2>Page 1</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Page 1 was missing a DOCTYPE, html tag, and some contents of the header tag.</li>
            <li>I also added the charset UTF-8 as it was missing.</li>
            <li>On line 67 there was no closing "em" tag, it was misspelled as an e tag.</li>
         </ul>
     <h2>Page 2</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Line 14 did not have a closing b tag</li>
            <li>On line 40 there was an h2 tag inside of the b tag. But the hierarchy of tags does not allow this to happen so I switched them.</li>
            <li>There was a broken href tag that said "where do i go" so I switched it with the broken link address that was given before.</li>
            <li>There was an issue with header tag hierarchy, the webpage did not look good because it went from h1 to h4 to h3. History also had an h6 so I made everything uniform.</li>
         </ul>
     <h2>Page 3</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Line 39 contained a spelling error, it should've been a li tag but it was a l tag. </li>
            <li>  Line 68 was missing a closing td tag for the table.</li>
            <li>I also changed the format of the table. The Headers were mixed up, So i just changed the pictures based on what they had as a table header. </li>
         </ul>
     <h2>Page 4</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Page 4 did not contain a DOCTYPE.</li>
            <li>It also did not have alt information for any of the pictures.</li>
            <li>Line 29 was missing a td tag.</li>
         </ul>
