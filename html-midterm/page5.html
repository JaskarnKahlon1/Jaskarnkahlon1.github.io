     <h2>Page 1</h2>
        <p> Page 1 was missing a DOCTYPE, html tag, and some contents of the header tag. I also added the charset UTF-8 as it was missing. On line 67 there was no closing "em" tag, it was misspelled as an e tag</p>
     <h2>Page 2</h2>
        <p> Line 14 did not have a closing b tag, and on line 40 there was an h2 tag inside of the b tag. But the hierarchy of tags does not allow this to happen so I switched them. There was a broken href tag that said "where do i go" so I switched it with the broken link address that was given before. </p>
     <h2>Page 3</h2>
        <p> Line 39 contained a spelling error, it should've been a li tag but it was a l tag. Line 68 was missing a closing td tag for the table.</p>
     <h2>Page 4</h2>
        <p> Page 4 did not contain a DOCTYPE, it also did not have alt information for any of the pictures. line 29 was missing a td tag</p>
